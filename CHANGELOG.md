## [1.0.1] - 2024-04-24

### Changed

- Changed admin UI to allow configuration of display to either use buttons or dropdowns for teleport locations. For a small number of items (or if on a tablet), buttons may work better - but for larger lists each player can change their settings to use a dropdown instead. These options are persisted on a per player basis.
- Teleport destinations are now sorted alphabetically.
- Re-ordered main menu in order of likely use (i.e. config options at the end).
